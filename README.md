## End-to-End Encryption

The script located at `./end-to-end-encryption/recover.php` can recover your precious files if you encrypted them with the **Nextcloud End-to-End Encryption** and still have access to the data directory and the user mnemonics.

For further information have a look at the [**README**](./end-to-end-encryption/README.md) of the script.

## Server-Side Encryption

The script located at `./server-side-encryption/recover.php` can recover your precious files if you encrypted them with the **Nextcloud Server-Side Encryption** and still have access to the data directory and the Nextcloud configuration file (`config/config.php`).
It supports the master-key encryption, the user-key encryption and can even use the rescue key if it had been enabled as well as the public sharing key for files that had been publicly shared.

For further information have a look at the [**README**](./server-side-encryption/README.md) of the script.

## Testing

The compatibility with Nextcloud releases is tested with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de).
For every major release there is a separate set of files that has been generated by the corresponding Nextcloud release.
To test the support of legacy encryption schemes, additional sets of files have been generated with older Owncloud releases.
Due to their size the test data are located in the separate repositories [nextcloud/end-to-end-encryption-testdata](https://github.com/nextcloud/end-to-end-encryption-testdata) and [nextcloud/server-side-encryption-testdata](https://github.com/nextcloud/server-side-encryption-testdata).

All test suites can be executed as follows:

```
./phpunit.sh
```
